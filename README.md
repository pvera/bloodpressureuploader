# bloodpressureuploader
A windows command line tool to bulk upload blood pressure readings to online tools like MyChart®

Nothing special here's it's just a vb.net cli app that parses a CSV with blood pressure readings and submits it to my HMO's MyChart®. 
I am in no way affiliated with MyChart® is a registered trademark of Epic Systems Corporation, a Wisconsin-based entity.

If you are getting readings out of range, dial 911.
